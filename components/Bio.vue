    simplifying financial connectivity so tech teams can build and ship fast.

    With nearly a decade of experience in the tech industry, I'm dedicated to
    empowering developers to craft delightful, connected experiences. Before
    joining <b>Atomic</b> as a Developer Advocate, I served as a Developer
    Advocate at <b>Fluree</b>, a semantic graph database company, and have
    developed software solutions at <b>Lincoln Financial</b>, <b>Volvo</b>, and
    <b>Bank of America</b> across areas including web development, natural
    language understanding, automation, and data integrations.

  <p class="mt-6">
    Building tools that help technical teams succeed has become a passion of
    mine; whether that tool is a well-architected docs site, a demo repo, a
    thoughtful diagram, a clear presentation of an integration architecture. I
    lead with empathy, aiming to understand and streamline the end-to-end
    journey of developers to make their work lives more efficient, productive,
    and focused on outcomes, not obstacles.
